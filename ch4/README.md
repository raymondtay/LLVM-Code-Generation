A `phi` instruction copies the input value from the related control flow edge
to the definition of the phi. For instance, in ![SSA form of a program](./images/program_SSA_form.png), when the
control flow goes from `BB1` to `BB3` (that is, the left edge â€“ the first value of the phi),
`var1` is copied into `var3`. When the control flow goes from `BB2` to `BB3`,
the second value, `var2`, is copied into `var3`.

To put it differently, `phi` instructions act as if a copy were inserted
on the related incoming edge.

In the LLVM IR and Machine IR levels, `phi` instructions are grouped together
at the beginning of _basic blocks_. It is invalid to insert non-`phi`
instructions before `phi` instructions.

`Phi` instructions are mapped to the `PHINode` class, which is a subclass of
the `Instruction` class, in the LLVM IR and to the `MachineInstr` class
with `getOpcode() == PHI` in the Machine IR.

The optimization in the LLVM IR responsible for promoting memory locations to
SSA values is `mem2reg`.

# Def-use and use-def chains

`Def-use` and `use-def` chains are fundamental concepts in data flow analysis,
enabling the efficient tracking of value definitions and uses in programming.

`Def-use` chains refer to the relationship between a definition of a value and
its subsequent uses, allowing for efficient tracking of value usage.
This concept is essential in data flow analysis, as it enables the
identification of value sources and sinks.

`Use-def` chains, on the other hand, represent the relationship between a value's
use and its definition, enabling the identification of value sources.
By analyzing these chains, developers can optimize program performance, reduce errors,
and enhance code maintainability.
